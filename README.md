# UniFormNg

This is an Angular 15+ library, that automatically builds and renders highly customizable dynamic forms based on JSON data.

License: `MIT`

### Out of the box, you get:

- ready to use well-designed forms (Google's Material design);
- a well-tested and low-coding solution that requires only JSON data;
- dynamic fields based on Angular reactive forms;
- full access to the form object for the easy customization;
- rendering of standard validation errors (required, min, max, ...), which you can simply tweak to your liking;

Check out our docs [here](https://uformng.web.app).

## How to connect?

Run: `npm i uni-form-ng`

You do NOT need to install `"@angular/forms"`, `"@angular/material"` or any other dependencies.

Then you need to add a dependency into your Angular Module:

```
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserAnimationsModule,
    HttpClientModule,

    UniFormModule,
  ],
  providers: [{ provide: MAT_FORM_FIELD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS, useValue: { appearance: 'outline' }}] // optional
})
```

In main styles file (styles.css) please add:

```
@import "@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css";
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons");
```
